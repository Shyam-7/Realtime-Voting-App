# Realtime-Voting-App
##FSD - Assignment - 1: Case Study 6: Real-Time Voting Application
##To run the application:
Start the backend server:
Open a new terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project's backend directory, and run:
Copycd path/to/real-time-voting-app/backend
node server.js
You should see a message like "Server running on port 3001" (or whichever port you've configured).
Start the frontend React application:
Open a new terminal or command prompt (keep the backend one running), navigate to your project's root directory, and run:
Copycd path/to/real-time-voting-app
npm start
This will start the React development server. It should automatically open a browser window with your app. If it doesn't, you can manually open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000
